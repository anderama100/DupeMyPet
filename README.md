# Purpose

This game provides an analogy of the logic behind Object Oriented Programming (OOP). For people who are learning this process, this game may be is a useful resource to understand major concepts involved in OOP.

# Rationale
## What is OOP?

In programming, we abstract objects from real life. It means, the programmer uses real life’s logic and turns it into a code.

| Object  | Attributes |
| --- | --- |
| mammals | They are warm-blooded
|         | They have backbones.
|         | They all produce milk to feed their young. |
| car     | It has doors |
|         | It has Wheels|

This is the logic that programmers use when working on Object Orienting Programming. The general class is the category that includes objects that share specific attributes and/or behaviors. 

## Why an analogy?

The logic behind OPP may be complex for a beginner programmer. So, I decided to create an analogy that helps us understand this logic. The user will design a pet, and with each selection, they will see the specific concept represented and the code generated by it. 

Analogies are high-order processing strategies that connect familiar and unfamiliar ideas:

*The capacity for making and learning analogies is clearly at the heart of advanced human cognitive capabilities and of creativity (. . .) Analogy simply means sameness or resemblance of two objects or processes at some level of abstraction. Analogy-making is being able to see familiar things in a different manner than usually, thus enabling some unfamiliar things to look similar to some familiar ones. This process depends on the ability to combine, split and rearrange existing concepts, and on the ability to reason about relationships.*

```JavaScript
Button "Begin Shape Mold" ---> class petShape{
constructor(Name, ColorEyes, ColorHair, Size)
}
```

```JavaScript
Button "Create New Pet" ---> new Doggie extends PetShape{
Name: 'Scooby',
Eyes: '#00ffff',
Hair: '#ff8000',
Size: '2',
}
```

```JavaScript
Form "Features" To Overload & Overwrite SuperClass Methods
if(NewPet === 'Dog'){

     dog.setFamily('John, Maria, kevin');//overloading
     dog.setMakeNoise('hau, hau');//overwritting

#Rationale
What is OOP?
In programming, we abstract objects from real life. It means, the programmer uses real lifeâ€™s logic and turns it into a code.
Weâ€™re surrounded by â€œobjectsâ€ (living and non-living things) that belong to a specific general category (or class) because they share specific attributes and/or behaviors.

This is the logic that programmers use when working on Object Orienting Programming. The general class is the category that includes objects that share specific attributes and/or behaviors.
